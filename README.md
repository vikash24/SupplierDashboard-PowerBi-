# SupplierDashboard-PowerBi-

Business Case: 
The Accounts Department of the Company maintains the invoice level details of all vendors for each part procured. The Business Planner receives invoice data from the Accounts Department for each vendor and collects the supplier and part level information separately from the Purchase Department. The Business Planner has to study the relevant data and identify the Procurement trends, Supplier limitations, Product based supplier consolidation and minimise cost impact to company.

Problem Statement: 
As the collected Data is of different years for multiple Plants grouped by different Business Units. The parts are either made of Aluminium or Ferrous of different raw material grade alloys, with the source being either Tier 1 supplier or Tier 2 supplier. Considering all these factors, create a dashboard which is insightful on all these factors and can help the Procurement Department make better supply chain strategic decisions.

Task is to build a dashboard page and name it as “Supplier Overview”, which gives us a supplier status and its capabilities. Also, categorizing them as per the data provided in the data set. This will help the responsible Purchase Group (Buyer) get a focused quick insight for the suppliers.
